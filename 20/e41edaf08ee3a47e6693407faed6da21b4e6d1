RFC v2:
	* Add a test case for vlan netdevice on top of a lag.
	* Reword return error messages.
	* Create one service function invoked from two wrappers with different
	  protocol parameters instead of creating two similar functions.
	* Fix the test so it has one case of testing creation of VLAN on top of
	  a free-standing front panel port and one for creation of VLAN on top
	  of a bridge front panel port.
	* Remove an empty line.
	* Drop lines in comment.
