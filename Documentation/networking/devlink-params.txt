Devlink configuration parameters
================================
Following is the list of configuration parameters via devlink interface.
Each parameter can be generic or driver specific and are device level
parameters.

Note that the driver-specific files should contain the generic params
they support to, with supported config modes.

Each parameter can be set in different configuration modes:
	runtime		- set while driver is running, no reset required.
	driverinit	- applied while driver initializes, requires restart
			driver by devlink reload command.
	permanent	- written to device's non-volatile memory, hard reset
			required.

Following is the list of parameters:
====================================
fw_load_policy		[DEVICE, GENERIC]

			Valid values:
			* DEVLINK_PARAM_FW_LOAD_POLICY_VALUE_DRIVER (0)
			  Load firmware version preferred by the driver.
			* DEVLINK_PARAM_FW_LOAD_POLICY_VALUE_FLASH (1)
